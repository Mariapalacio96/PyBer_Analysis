# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The porpuse of this analysis is to develop a code to create s multi line graph with the goal of showing the total fares for each city. We will be abble to inspect the data set easier since we will be finding different information wich will be needed at the time of making a decision. For example some averages.

## Results
### Total rides for each city
- Rural = 125
- Suburban = 625
- Urban = 1625

### Total driver for each city
- Rural = 78
- Suburban = 490
- Urban = 2405

### Total amount of fares for each city
- Rural = 4327.93
- Suburban = 19356.33
- Urban = 39854.38

### Average fare per ride for each city
- Rural = 34.62
- Suburban = 30.97
- Urban = 24.53

### Average fare per driver
- Rural = 55.49
- Suburban = 39.50
- Urban = 16.57

After looking at all those numbers, we can infer that there are more rides and drivers in the urban cities. Also, the urban cities have the highest fares but the higher average fare per ride and driver have it the rural cities.

In the following image we can see al the information above:

## Summary
The difference between the amount of drivers in the urban cities and the amount of drivers in the suburban and rural cities has a notorious difference. the amount of drivers may be directly proporcional to the amount of rides. For example the urban cities have a large amount of drivers as well as rides. The rural has the lowest amount of drivers as wee as the lowest amount of rides. So if we increase the amount of drivers we may increase the avility of taking more rides each week.

One of the best ways to increase drivers and rides is to offer some incentives to drivers and riders on the rural cities to encourage them to use our platform.
